About me? Just a few lines to describe myself and what I was doing during my life.
My name is Fabri Di Napoli
I was born in Italy, lot of years ago, but since 2011 I've been living (and working) in Barcelona.
When I was a kid I started to love technology, starting from video games, than computers and finally programming.
I was very interested on how computer works, what there is behind a web page or how software can do magic stuffs.
So in 2006 I "found" my vocation and I started to study Programming. I turned Web developer.
As programming is my vocation, my fun and my job, I never stop learning programming languages, reading books, articles, news and more.
I learned a lot of interesting stuffs within this years: OOP, TDD, Design Patterns, Agile Development, Web Development, Java, Hadoop, Linux...and lot more.
Another thing I like to do, but probably I'm not so good enough :-), is to share my knowledge.
That's why I build this website. I hope you enjoy it.

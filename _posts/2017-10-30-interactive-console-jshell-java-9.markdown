One of the nice news of Java 9 is the introduction of a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop): `JShell`
Let's take a look at how to use it.

## Running JShell
If you have the latest version of the JDF installed just run `/bin/jshell`.

## Running with Docker
If you don't have Java 9 installed, you can run it using Docker:

`docker run -it openjdk:9-jdk /bin/jshell`
Optionally, you can create an alias of this command in your `~/.bashrc`, to avoid running it each time.

## Useful commands

Taking a look at variables you declared:
```
/vars
```

Listing resources you typed:
```
/list
```

Opening a file:
```
/open filepath
```

and, very important, to exit:
```
/exit
```

For the entire list of available commands run: `/help`

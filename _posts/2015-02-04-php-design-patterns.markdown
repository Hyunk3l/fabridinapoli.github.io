### Just another example of Design Patterns in PHP.

I created a repository in Github just some hours ago: [PHP Design Patterns](https://github.com/Hyunk3l/php-design-patterns)

The question is: do people need ANOTHER repo containing Design Patterns example code? The answer is NO!

So, why do I do this? Lot of motivations:

* I love OOD
* I need to improve OOD
* I want to share and discuss my code and my point of view
*Try to help others and share knowledges

By now I've pushed just only one pattern: Abstract Factory. It's the first of the Creational patterns and one of the most useful but probably hard to understand/implement.

This post does not pretend to be your definitive guide to docker, itâ€™s just my own experience.
What about environments?
Local environment: a virtual machine with software installed manually.
PHP 5.5, MariaDb 5.5, Sphinx and Redis. Each dev had it own personalization in virtual machine.

Production environment: same software as local env, same minor versions, but different bugfixes. Big differences between configs.

## Changes in code

### Config
Is your code prepared to support multiple environments? If answer is no, here is a possible solution for you.
1. Choose a way to manage your environment variables: [DotEnv](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dotenv.html) with plane php or [Symfony Config](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/config.html).
2. In my case I chose DotEnv. Create a .env.* file for each environment, example: .env.dev, .env.pre, .env.prod
3. Now you will need to copy all those environment-sensitive things like: urls, paths, services host, usernames etc, within the .evn files
   An example:
   ```php
   if ($environment === "dev") {
      $url = "http://service-dev-env-url";
   } else if ($environment === "pre") {
      $url = "http://service-pre-env-url";
   } 
   ```
   you will have in `.env.dev`
   ```php
   SERVICE_URL=http://service-dev-env-url
   ```
   
   and in `.env.pre`
   ```php
   SERVICE_URL=http://service-pre-env-url
   ```
   
   so your code will be simplified to something like:
   
   ```php
   $url = $config->getServiceUrl();
   ```
